# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

Welcome to my first blog post! This post demonstrates how to use MDX with Next.js to create a powerful blogging platform.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Features

Here are some cool features you can use with MDX:

- **Markdown syntax** for easy writing
- **React components** embedded directly in your content
- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** support

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Conclusion

MDX makes it easy to create rich, interactive content for your blog. Stay tuned for more posts!
