# React Best Practices for 2024

As React continues to evolve, here are some best practices to keep your code clean and maintainable.

## Use Server Components When Possible

With Next.js 13+, Server Components are the default. They offer several advantages:

- **Reduced bundle size** - Server components don't ship JavaScript to the client
- **Better performance** - Direct database access without API routes
- **Improved SEO** - Content is rendered on the server

```tsx
// This is a Server Component by default in Next.js App Router
async function BlogList() {
  const posts = await getPosts(); // Direct database access

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Keep Components Small and Focused

Each component should have a single responsibility:

```tsx
// Good: Small, focused component
function UserAvatar({ src, alt }: { src: string; alt: string }) {
  return <img src={src} alt={alt} className="rounded-full w-10 h-10" />;
}

// Use it in a larger component
function UserProfile({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserAvatar src={user.avatar} alt={user.name} />
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Use TypeScript

TypeScript catches errors before runtime and improves developer experience:

```typescript
interface Post {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  publishedAt: Date;
}

function BlogPost({ post }: { post: Post }) {
  return <article>{post.title}</article>;
}
```

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you build more maintainable React applications. Happy coding!
